Note: the current version of the project is version 3 at [https://github.com/langaracpsc/coursys](https://github.com/langaracpsc/coursys). However, this github repository will remain active as moving this codebase to Next.js is not currently planned as it will take a lot of time.


# Langara Course Planner

Welcome to the github repository of the Langara Course Planner!
This is a tool that helps you more efficiently plan our courses at Langara College.

Please contact Highfire1 if you have any questions or suggestions or would like to contribute.

Although we are using Flask as a web server, the main page is static and the framework is used only for the /course/ pages
